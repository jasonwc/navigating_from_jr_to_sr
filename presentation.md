# Hi, I'm __Jason!__

---

Feb 2015 - Started at MasteryConnect as a Jr.
March 2016 - Started at Mavenlink as a Mid

---

## What about those __inbetween__ bits?

---

# [fit] My Journey

---
## We'll discuss:

1) Looking for a Job
2) Jr
3) Mid
5) Team Lead
4) Senior

---

# [fit] A _few_ caveats

---

## This journey is __different for everyone__

---

## Jr/Mid/Senior are __nebulous__ terms that can mean __vastly different__ things for each company

---

## Circumstances can __accelerate__ this timeline

---

## Not every company __values__ the same things

---

#[fit] Looking for a Job

---

## A few __rules of thumb__

---

## 1) Show you can __learn__, be _excited to learn_

---

## 2) Have some projects you can point to and __talk about__

---

## 3) Don't be a __jerk__

---

## 4) __Don't__ be a jerk

---

# How did I land my first job?

---

## Connections

---

## Specifically I _spoke at a lot of meetups_
---

## One day... I met someone looking for an employee!

---

## Introductions are _always_ __the best way__ to get a job

---

# [fit] Jr

---

## This part __will__ feel hard...

---

## _Imposter syndrome_

---

## Focuses: 
## __Learning the ropes, feeling comfortable__

---

## 1) _Learn_ as much as possible*

---

## _*this may include learning on your own time_

---

## Lots of options
- Courses
- Books
- Code katas
- Side projects

---

## This is the __best time__ of your career to do these extracurriculur activities.

---

## When you're more advanced, just do them when you want to __for fun!__

---

## 2) Ask __good__ questions

---

## Whats a __good__ question?

---

## Hey Senior Engineer, I can't figure out **X**. Will you help me?

Bad

---

## Hey Senior Engineer, I'm having a problem with **X**. It's supposed to be doing **Y**, but its not.

Better

---

## Hey Senior Engineer, I'm having a problem with **X**. It's supposed to be doing **Y**, but its not. I think it might be because of **Z**. Will you help me?

Best

---

## 3) Ship some code

---

- get confident writing code
- solving problems
- learning patterns

---

## 4) Find a __mentor__

---

## I've had several mentors over the years, and each has taught me something different

---

![fit](./holdy.jpeg)

---

## Ryan "Holdy" Holdaway
- Software Engineer at Mastery Connect
- Taught me that I knew more than I thought I did 

---

## James Thompson
- Principle Software Engineer at Mavenlink
- Taught me about good design and working with the business

---

## Andy Leavitt and JB Steadman
- Director of Engineering and SVP of Engineering at Mavenlink
- Taught me about running teams and being pragmattic

---

## Find mentors that will help you __learn what you need__ to at your level

---

## [fit] Things to avoid

---

## 1) Paralysis

---

## 2) Being _too hard_ on yourself

---

# [fit] Mid

---

## Focus: 
## __Be productive, build a name, work well with others__

---

## 1) Find something and __own it__

---
## Some things I've owned over the years
- Introducing React
- Intermittent Failures
- Production exception tracking

---

## 2) Solve __pain points__ for the team

---

## Think of something annoying __to you__...

---

## ... it's probably annoying __to others__ too!

---

## An example

---

## Deploy emails

---

## 10 pull requests go out...

---

## Each pull request _may_ have a user facing change...

---

## ... and developers might not have written a blurb!

---

## Compiling this email is __painful__

---

## Automated it!

---

## And there was much rejoicing

---

## The kicker?

___

## It was __fun__, not too difficult, and made me __seem like a wizard__!

---

## 3) Build __notoriety__

---

## Mid Engineer _gets shit done!_

---

## This is good!

---

## 4) Start to __teach__ others

---

## One of the best way to learn

---

## More and more, this __is__ the value that you add

---

## 5) Start to think of the __user__ and __collaborate__ with the business

---

## [fit] Things To Avoid

---

## 1) Cockiness

---

## Rockstar syndrome

---

## Remember _don't be a jerk?_

---

## Nobody wants to __work with__ or __promote__ a jerk

---

# A fork in the road?

---

## __Management__ vs __Individual Contributor__

---

## Don't _necessarily_ have to decide.

---

## At some companies
## __senior == team lead__

---

## I've enjoyed __both__ roles

---

# Team Lead

---

## Focus: 
## __Be reliable, keep your team happy and growing, develop new processes__

---

## _psst this role may be more rewarding for you than an IC_

---

## 1) Grow __your__ team

---

## Let them spread their wings

---

## Help them be effective and build __their__ notoriety

---

## The success of __your__ team is __your__ success

---

## 2) Estimate __effectively__ and communicate __often__

---

## 3) Not just collaborate with the business, __partner__ with the business

---

## Solving problems for users is __the whole point__ of software engineering, __not-__ the fancy code you write

---

## As a team lead __you must__ understand this, and __help your team__ understand it

---

## 4) Experiment

---

## Constantly __improve__ your teams process

---

## Ship those processes to __other teams__

---

## __Nurture__ and __accept__ processes introduced by members of your team!

---

## Always __try__ out a suggestion, even if you don't agree. __Prove__ it works (or doesnt!)
---

## 5) Deliver results

---

## Helps if you can __estimate effectively__ and __communicate well__

---

## I never _"missed"_ a deadline as team lead

---

## [fit] Things To Avoid

---

## 1) Trying to do __everything__

---

## 2) Taking __too much credit__ for your team's work

---

## 3) Hurting team __morale__

---

## 4) Not being __up front__ about your teams capacity and deadline pressure

---

# [fit] Sr

---

## Focus: 
## __Stellar work, stellar mentorship__

---

## 1) __Grow__ those you work with

---

## 2) Be _the_ guy/gal

---

## Reputation, reputation

---

## ...as a good __engineer__

---

## ...as a good __mentor__

---

## ...as a good __human__ to work with

---

## 3) Be effective __wherever you are__

---

## As I rotated off of team lead, I was put on new projects that were __struggling__

---

## My job was to __move those projects forward__

---

## 4) Give technical guidance, but try __not__ to build it all yourself

---

## Remember that you want to __level up others__ too!

---

## Things To Avoid

---

## 1) Building it all yourself

---

## 2) Disappearing

---

# How to know when its time to move on?

---

## Three questions

---

## 1) Am I __still learning__ new skills?

---

## 2) Is there __opportunity for advancement__?

---

## 4) Am I being __compensated fairly__?

---

## If the answer for __two__ of those things is __no__, it _might_ be time to move on

---

## Usually those are __negotiable;__ a good company __wants to invest__ in you. That's been my experience at __Mavenlink__

---

#[fit] Random Tidbits

---

## Try to be as __full stack__ as possible

---

## Change teams __frequently__

---

## Try to keep it __fun__

---

## __Give back__ to the community

---

## Don't focus __too__ much on the trendy stuff
